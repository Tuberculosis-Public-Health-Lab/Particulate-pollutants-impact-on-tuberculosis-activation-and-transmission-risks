Our esteemed team at the Stop.TB.Hub has undertaken a rigorous analysis to elucidate the intricate relationships between exposure to airborne particulate pollutants, notably PM10 and PM2.5, and several crucial tuberculosis (TB)-related outcomes. 
These outcomes encompass the delayed manifestation of TB incidence, as documented through comprehensive disease monitoring and specialized TB reporting systems, the endogenous reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections within individuals, and the exogenous transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the ambient environment.

In an effort to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and to foster collaborative endeavors, we have made the raw data and R code utilized in our meticulous analysis publicly accessible. This initiative underscores our commitment to advancing peer exchange and scholarly cooperation.

For those interested in academic inquiries or desiring further elaboration on our study, we kindly request that you correspond with the custodians of the data and R code.
