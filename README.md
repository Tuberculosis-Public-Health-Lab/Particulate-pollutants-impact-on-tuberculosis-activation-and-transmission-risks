This study was conducted by our team at Stop.TB.Hub to analyze the relationship between exposure to airborne particulate pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5) 
and the delayed risk of tuberculosis incidence (based on diagnosed case data from tuberculosis-specific reporting systems), 
the risk of endogenous reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection within the host, 
and the risk of exogenous transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the external environment. 

We have provided the raw data and R code used for our analysis to ensure the reproducibility of the results. 
We hereby make the data and code publicly available for peer exchange and collaboration.




For any academic inquiries related to this study, please communicate with the providers of the data and R code.
