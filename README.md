Our esteemed team at the Stop.TB.Hub conducted an in-depth analysis to elucidate the complex associations between exposure to airborne particulate pollutants, specifically PM10 and PM2.5, and several pivotal tuberculosis (TB)-related outcomes. 
These outcomes include the delayed manifestation of TB incidence, as recorded through disease monitoring and specialized TB reporting systems, the endogenous reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection within individuals, and the exogenous transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the surrounding environment.

To ensure transparency, reproducibility, and to encourage collaborative efforts, we have made the raw data and R code employed in our meticulous analysis publicly available. This step reflects our dedication to promoting peer exchange and scholarly cooperation.

For those interested in academic inquiries or desiring further elaboration on our study, we kindly request that you correspond with the custodians of the data and R code. Below, you will find the pertinent contact details for the principal investigator:
